1) What are the entities that I need to store to support the business logic of my application?

2) Which entity's table should be the 'owner' of any given piece of information that I want to store?

3) For any given piece of information (a column in a table), what 'type' should it be? 

4) Are there any special restrictions that I should place on any given column? (NOT NULL, etc.)
